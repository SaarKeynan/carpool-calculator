# carpool-calculator
Algorithm to calculate carpool routes.
A reduction of MTSP (Multiple Travelling Salesman Problem), where the salesmen start in different locations, all end in one location, and have passenger capacities.

The algorithm used is based on the one detailed in [this paper](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/236340854_A_new_crossover_approach_for_solving_the_multiple_travelling_salesmen_problem_using_genetic_algorithms).

Written by Saar Keynan and Omer Shoshani
## Notes
The GUI doesn't allow configuring many variables used in the simulation, such as the passenger capacities, however the algorithm still works when they're changed.
